Here is Henry Gong. I used to be an algorithm engineer at Plus and currently working for BMW as a software developer. I got my masters from the Technical University of Denmark. Github is one of important portals for me to connect to the world. 

Since this is my personal github account, I cannot push work-related code here. But I will update some works that might interesting. So, please check it out and give a star.
